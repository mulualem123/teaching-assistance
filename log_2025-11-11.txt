Summary of Changes and Improvements:

1.  **Authentication UI Overhaul:**
    *   Redesigned the `login.html` and `register.html` pages with a modern, user-friendly interface using Bootstrap 5.
    *   Enhancements include a professional card-based layout, application logo, intuitive input fields with icons, and improved navigation links (e.g., "Forgot Password?", "Register here").

2.  **Flask-Security Integration and Configuration:**
    *   Configured the application in `__init__.py` to use the new custom templates for login and registration.
    *   Enabled `SECURITY_REGISTERABLE`, `SECURITY_RECOVERABLE`, and `SECURITY_CHANGEABLE` features to provide a complete authentication workflow.
    *   Created an `ExtendedRegisterForm` in `forms.py` to add a `username` field to the registration process and configured the app to use it.

3.  **Error Resolution and Bug Fixes:**
    *   **BuildError:** Resolved errors for missing `security.forgot_password` and `security.register` URL endpoints by enabling the necessary features.
    *   **UndefinedError:** Fixed a Jinja2 error (`'RegisterForm' has no attribute 'username'`) by implementing the `ExtendedRegisterForm`.
    *   **AssertionError:** Corrected an application startup crash by removing a duplicate `/favicon.ico` route.
    *   **ImportError:** Fixed a startup failure by updating an import statement in `__init__.py` to reflect a renamed form class.
    *   **SMTPSenderRefused:** Prevented a server crash during registration by temporarily disabling confirmation emails with `SECURITY_SEND_REGISTER_EMAIL = False`. This allows user registration to succeed while email server credentials are being configured.

Overall, the authentication system is now more robust, user-friendly, and correctly integrated with the Flask-Security extension. The application is stable and the major bugs encountered during development have been resolved.
