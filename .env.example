# Example .env template for teaching-assistance
#
# Copy this file to a local file named `.env` (or set these as real environment
# variables on your host / CI) and fill in values. NEVER commit a file with
# real secrets into git. Keep this file in the repo only as an example.

# Flask / application
# A long random value. In production set a strong secret (do NOT commit it).
SECRET_KEY=
# Optional salt for password hashing (e.g. flask-security). Keep secret.
SECURITY_PASSWORD_SALT=

# Admin account used by management commands (use example placeholders)
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=change-me

# Database (example): change to your production DB URL if needed.
# For local development we use SQLite in the instance folder.
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///flask_package/instance/site.db

# Mail / SMTP (if used)
MAIL_SERVER=smtp.example.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=
MAIL_PASSWORD=
MAIL_USE_TLS=true
MAIL_USE_SSL=false

# Third-party service tokens (placeholders) — set these as env vars in deployment
# Example: TELEGRAM_TOKEN=123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=
# Sentry, AWS, etc.
SENTRY_DSN=
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=

# Notes:
#  - Keep secrets out of the repository. Use a secret manager or environment
#    variables for production.
#  - You can keep a local .env for development but add it to .gitignore.
#  - To load this file in dev, you can use python-dotenv or similar tools.
